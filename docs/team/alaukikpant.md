## Overview

TechToday Information Tracker(TTIT) is a Command Line Application(CLI) designed for lifelong learners of Computer Science or closely related disciplines to manage information about technology. TTIT not only helps a user access and save latest information about articles and jobs from HackerNews, but can also be used to save articles/jobs/notes that the user wants to input themselves.

## Summary of Contributions 

### Code contributed:

#### What it does:

#### Justification:
* This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only save job questions/articles that they find interesting manually, but also make a quick browse and save the latest articles from a quality news source.						Highlights: This enhancement complements existing functionalities and commands because you can view new articles/jobs and save them. It required reading the relevant API documentation and implementing it. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.Used the following sources to learn how to use the relevant API.
