When I think about things they are all sounds interesting to me, especially if they are connected to technology.<p>Unfortunatelly, the last week shows that I just cannot win with my laziness. I spend all the time lurking on the internet or watching youtube vides. I&#x27;ve tried ti blocked time-wasting pages (like 9gag&#x2F;reddit&#x2F;etc.) but it clearly didn&#x27;t help at all. I have a lot of books and articles to read, topics to explore, projects to finish but every time when I&#x27;m trying to dig into it I end up feeling tired and resigned. It really makes me worry about myself, because I&#x27;m wasting so much time!<p>What can I do to improve my attitude toward useful areas of my life and convince myself to stop wasting time?\"","timestamp":"\"2020-Mar-23 Mon 07:32 AM\"","category":"\"default\"","extract":"\"\""}},{"2":{"title":"\"Ask HN: How is everyone feeling?\"","text":"\"It does feel a bit weird to me sometimes to be reading about JavaScript or something on HN in the midst of all this but it’s also been a way for me to cope.<p>Given that HNers are more likely to spend time on their own I’m wondering on how fellow HNers are coping with all the stress and anxiety.\"","timestamp":"\"2020-Mar-23 Mon 07:09 AM\"","category":"\"default\"","extract":"\"\""}}]
